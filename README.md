## Surveytools2
Surveytools2 is a collection of R functions that make working with dplyr on survey analysis just a little bit better.  Inspired by dplyr and my previous surveytools package.

## Installation

This package is not yet available from CRAN. To install the latest development builds directly from GitHub, run this instead:

```R
if (!require("devtools")) install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github('peterhurford', 'surveytools')
```

## Examples

* [The .impact survey](https://github.com/peterhurford/imsurvey/blob/master/imsurvey.R)
